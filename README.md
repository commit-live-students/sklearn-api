# Load inbuilt dataset from sklearn

`sklearn` provides an inbuilt library of practise datasets which can be accessed through `datasets` module. 
We have accessed one such datasets `load_iris` during the classroom session. 

Now, we will use an another of such datasets named `load_daibetes`.

## Write `load_data()` function:

* The function should load `load_diabetes` dataset from sklearn's inbuilt datasets:
* Accepts no parameters
* Returns a tuple of:

    - feature matrix of `load_diabetes`
    - target array of `load_diabetes`
